# in-the-red

This is a daily scheduler based on a 9-5 eight hour work day.  The time blocks turn grey when they are in the past, green for the future, and red for the present hour.

## About

This is my first project using moment.js, Bootstrap, and JQuery. I also incorporated some vanilla JavaScript.
The application utilizes local storage to save the day's events.
